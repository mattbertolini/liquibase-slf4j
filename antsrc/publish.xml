        There is a problem with the Ivy publish tasks when using the Ant package found in Homebrew. The Homebrew package
        installs a version of Ivy in Ant's main classpath. This version may be older than the version of Ivy used by
        this build. This results in NoClassDefFound errors when trying to use BouncyCastle to sign jars. Try to use an
        installation of Ant not from Homebrew.
